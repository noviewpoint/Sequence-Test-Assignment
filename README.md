## Instructions for the assignment

We'd like you to design a vending machine in code.

The machine should perform as follows:

1. Once an item is selected and the appropriate amount of money is inserted, the machine should return the correct product.
2. It should also return change if too much money is provided, or ask for more money if insufficient funds have been inserted.
3. The machine should take an initial load of products and change. The change will be in denominations of 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, 50¢, $1.
4. There should be a way of reloading either products or change at a later point.
5. The machine should keep track of the products and change that it contains.

Feel free to develop the machine in any language that you're comfortable in.

## Running the application
